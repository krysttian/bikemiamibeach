# [BikeMiamiBeach.org](https://bikemiamibeach.org/) A community Drivien Bike Map

### Overview
Bike Miami Beach is an effort around providing better access and discovery of Bike Infrastruture in Miami Beach Florida. 
The goal is to improve the experience of biking on miami beach for everyday users, tourists, and everyone else.  Our most important considerations are saftey, speed, and ease in getting around the city.

### Strategy
Some of the key questions this site is trying to address is:
- Which route is the safest, easiest, and more enjoyable
- Where can I safely Park my bike?
- I have a flat where can I try to fix it?
- Where can I rent a Bike?
- How can I provied feed back about facilities (Broken repair stations, missing infrastructure, or advisories for other bicyclist)

### Advocacy
We'd like to help decision makers make informed decisions, understand the communities sentiment, and prioritize efforts.

### Website
Currently bikemiamibeach.org points to a umap.openstreetmap.fr custom map using the cycle OSM view. This view includes:
- Bike Parking Stations
- Bike Repair Stations
- Outline of Bicycle Paths
- Bathroom Facitilies
- Water Stations
